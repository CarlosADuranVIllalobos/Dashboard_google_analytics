## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL**: For data querying, manipulation, and efficient storage of large datasets, enabling faster and more scalable analysis.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive and automated dashboards.
- **Python**: For scripting data extraction, processing tasks, and predictive modeling.
- **Anaconda**: A distribution that includes Python, Spyder, Jupyter Notebooks, and other data science tools, providing a comprehensive environment for data analysis and modeling.
- **DB Browser for SQLite**: A high-quality, open-source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.
- **SQLite ODBC Driver**: A driver that allows Power BI to connect directly to SQLite databases, enabling efficient data retrieval for dashboards.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Access Setup**: Download the Kaggle dataset on user behaviors.
2. **Data Extraction and Transformation**: Use Python scripts to transform and prepare data for analysis.
3. **Metric Calculation**: Compute key metrics such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), Churn Rate, and Conversion Rate.
4. **Data Transformation to SQL**: The processed data is transformed and stored in an SQL database. This step leverages SQL's strengths for efficient data querying, storage, and integration with Power BI. 
5. **Dashboard Development**: Design and develop dynamic dashboards in Power BI.
6. **Predictive Modeling**: Implement predictive models to forecast customer churn and lifetime value.
7. **Automation and Reporting**: Implement automation scripts in Power BI to update dashboards regularly.
